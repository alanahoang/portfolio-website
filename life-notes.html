                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Life Notes is an app for users who have a difficult time getting started on a routine, missing out on events, or forgetting to do something important. Life Notes is here to make your life better! With an easy way to
                    manage tasks, it will definitely improve your well being and productivity.
                </p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    To design a productivity app that can be used daily or weekly. It focuses on simplicity and customization, which gives the app a personal touch. Life Notes's goal is to help users get organized and get things done more
                    efficiently.

            <div>
                <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to create an app that help users organize their schedule and get things done. Sometimes people find themselves forgetting something because there is too much going on. It can be difficult to remember everything
                    you're told. When there's many distractions out of your control, a to do list can help eliminate those frustrations. A to do list will remind you of all your responsibilities or plans, so you won't miss out on them next
                    time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My first approach with Life Notes involves analyzing other to do list apps. Two apps I looked at are Microsoft To Do and Rainbow ToDo List. I identified the use of design principles and heuristics of each app. I looked
                    for any patterns that I noticed in the apps. Below are some examples of features I implemented in my app.

                <p>I designed these icons on Adobe XD. They are filled by the following colors: black, white, or pastel colors.</p>

                    <p>On the right is my final logo for this project. My logo was designed with careful thought. While I was designing it, I thought about an open notebook and called it Notes Made Simple. I was thinking of notes in a form of a book. However, I changed it to notepad with a pencil and called it Life Notes. I felt like the new logo and name made more sense to me. Life Notes fits with the overall look of the app.</p>

                <p>
                    In my low-fidelty wireframes, I included the basic features needed for a to-do list app. Some of these features are creating new categories, editing a task, and much more. The biggest feature I wanted to implement is a
                    customization feature.

                <p>
                    As I was creating my logo for my next wireframes, I had a difficult time figuring out what font to use. Here, I made it a little cursive-like, but I later changed it because I felt the font wasn't consistent with the
                    app. I also updated the "Font Size" to a box because it falls in the same group as "Appearance" and "Fonts".

                <p>
                    I refined my final wireframes with a blue and white theme. In Appearance, I split the boxes into two colors. The color on the left is a primary color and the color on the right is the secondary color. This "color theme"
                    feature will apply color changes to the Category screen and the Date and Time screen.

                </picture>

                <p>Lastly, I added extra features, where you are able to upload pictures in your notes. This feature allow users to upload pictures and resizes them automatically to fit the screen.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges I faced during the design process were creating logos, icons, and deciding on what colors to choose. It wasn't easy because I wanted to make these elements balance out on my design. I would say the hardest
                    part was choosing the colors because I know if picked out a weak color palette, the design would look messy. I managed to find a color palette I like at the end.

            <div>
                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, I would like to make improvements on the filters, layouts, and designs of the app. I also want to explore more features that I am missing from this app. I'd like to get more user feedback on how to improve the
                    user experience.

            <div>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Life Notes is my first project and it has taught me the basics of UI Design. I have turned Life Notes into an app that is consistent, familiar, and cute. After exploring and testing features in the project, I can
                    conclude that Life Notes is functional and easy to use. If I could turn one of my designs into a real app, Life Notes would be the one.
